# `nrf-softdevice`

Low-level Rust bindings for Nordic Semiconductor nRF series SoftDevices.

Bindings are generated with `bindgen`, with extra post-processing to correctly generate the `svc`-based softdevice calls.

Generated code consists of inline functions using inline ASM, ensuring the lowest possible
overhead. Most of the times you'll see them inlined as a single `svc` instruction in the
calling function. Here is an example:

```rust
#[inline(always)]
pub unsafe fn sd_ble_gap_connect(
      p_peer_addr: *const ble_gap_addr_t,
      p_scan_params: *const ble_gap_scan_params_t,
      p_conn_params: *const ble_gap_conn_params_t,
      conn_cfg_tag: u8,
) -> u32 {
    let ret: u32;
    asm!("svc 140",
        inout("r0") p_peer_addr => res,
        inout("r1") p_scan_params => _,
        inout("r2") p_conn_params => _,
        inout("r3") conn_cfg_tag => _,
        lateout("r12") _,
    );
    ret
}
```

## Generating

The bindings are generated from the headers with the `gen.sh` script.
